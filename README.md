Smart Search Algorithm
This project implements a smart search algorithm that extracts entities from a search term and maps them to a relational database. The entities include cities, brands, dish types, and diets. The algorithm returns combinations of these entities based on the search term provided.

Overview
The algorithm parses the search term to identify entities such as cities, brands, dish types, and diets. It then queries the database to retrieve the corresponding entity information and constructs the entity combinations. The goal is to achieve optimal performance by making a single query to the database per function call.
